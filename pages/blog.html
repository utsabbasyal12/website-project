						<h1 id="IOT">Techonlogy in our daily lifes</h1><br>
					
					<p>
						Technology has changed our lives by increasing the speed of time. We are human. We invented and developed the technologies to change our life to its best. Now that technology is changing our live every second. Robots are our new human model and in the end, only robots control this world. Technology is now trying to go inside our body it’s almost there and the target is human blood and emotions. So, far! Technology is successful in that.

						In business, the use of Artificial Intelligence, cloud computing, machine learning, predictive analytics, and business intelligence tools, applications are now creating new methods to conduct, operate and manage the business.

						The rise of cloud computing, cloud storage,  Artificial intelligence, and Machine learning is the example, that we will be soon on the node that connects our body and capture the data of human activities in real-time. The invention and development of Technology have changed our life positively and negatively. The new technologies and inventions are results of our curiosity, creativity, and problem-solving techniques.

						<h1 id="IT">Internet Technology</h1>
						<p>The Internet is a vast network of networks that spans the entire globe. Data is transferred from computer to computer, and from network to network, using packet-switching technology and a suite of Internet protocols called TCP/IP, after its two most important protocols.The idea behind packet-switching was to break messages down into small blocks of data called packets that could be sent across a network independently of one another, and if necessary via different routes. The message would be reassembled by the receiver once all of the packets had arrived safely. If a packet was lost or damaged, it could be re-transmitted, avoiding the need to re-transmit the entire message from the beginning. The protocols used to transfer data across the network had to be robust and flexible enough to be able to deal with lost or damaged packets and adapt to the sudden loss of network links by finding a new route between the two communicating end points. The protocols also had to work over a number of different underlying network technologies, and on different operating systems and hardware platforms.</p><br>

						<h1 id="PI">Positve impact of technology</h1>
						<p>Technology plays a role in virtually every part of our lives, whether we’re aware of it or not. These are just a few of the ways in which technology may positively affect our physical and mental health:<br><br>

							1.health apps to track chronic illnesses and communicate vital information to doctors<br>
							2.health apps that help you track diet, exercise, and mental health information<br>
							3.online medical records that give you access to test results and allow you to fill prescriptions<br>
							4.virtual doctor visits<br>
							5.online education and ease of research<br>
							6.enhanced communication with others, which can improve the feeling of connection</p><br><br>
					
			
			
				
					
						<h1 id="NI">Negative impact of texhnology</h1>
						<p>The Internet has become a great tool for learning. You can google any information you need rather than spend time in the library or attend the course online without leaving home. Yet, tech involvement doesn’t always guarantee the quality of education. Children sometimes overuse technology in the classroom which obviously affects the learning process in a negative way. Plagiarism and cheating have increased while analysis and critical thinking have declined. This puts young generation thinking abilities in jeopardy. Various studies claim that the more students use entertainment technologies like games or social media, the less they perform academically. Instead of reading and doing homework, modern kids indulge in entertainment. A similar situation goes for the Internet: using the Web to search information is linked to higher grades while online gaming or socializing is associated with lower exam results. The reason for it is the distraction caused by games, messages, and videos. Young people have a hard time focusing attention at the lessons and resisting impulsive behavior.</p><br>
					
			
						<h1 id="Con">Conclusion</h1>
						<p>
    						There are clearly both pros and cons of adolescent technology use. The fact is, it is important for adolescents to learn and understand technology. It's become a part of daily life for all people to use a computer or a cell phone. It is necessary in most situations, especially for when they are older and have jobs. However, technology use must not be excessive. Extreme technological use in adolescents can cause all sorts of problems; socially and physically. It is important for adolescents to understand that yes, technology is an amazing thing; but at the same time, it should not be used all of the time. They should not be overly dependent on it. Adolescents need to learn that sometimes, technology is not the right answer for a situation.
